  <h2>The ABC of programming</h2>
  <h3>What is a script?</h3>
  <p>A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You can compare a script to a
    recipe that a cook or chef, would use in order to craete a dish. Scripts are made up of instructions that a computer
    can follow step by step. A web browser may use different parts of a script depending on how users interact with the
    web page. So, basically a script can run different sections of code in response to how people or users visting a web
    page interact with that web page.</p>
  <h3>Writing a script</h3>
  <p>In order to effectively write a script you first of all have to state the goal of the script and then split the
    goal into a series of
    tasks that need to completed in order to achieve the goal. You then have to write down individual steps that the
    computer needs to perform, in order to complete each individual task. These steps are then written in a programming
    language that the computer understands. Which in this case would be javascript.</p>
