  <h3>Elements</h3>
  <p>HTML uses elements to describe the structure of web pages. HTML code is made up of characters that live inside
    angled brackets, these are called HTML elements. For example,
    these are the HTML elements <b>(&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;)</b> that are used to create a paragraph on a web page. HTML
    elements
    are usually made up of two tags. An opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has a forward slash in it. For
    example, this is the opening tag <b>(&lt;p&gt;)</b> and closing tag <b>(&lt;/p&gt;)</b> that is used to create a
    paragraph
    on a web
    page. Each HTML element tells the web browser something about the information that sits between its opening and
    closing tags.The opening and closing tags act like containers for information. Also, the character between the
    angled
    brackets indicates the tag's purpose. For example, the character p stands for paragraph which indicates it is used
    to create paragraphs.</p>
  <p>The opening <b>&lt;html&gt;</b> tag indicates that anything between it and the <b>&lt;/html&gt;</b> closing tag
    is
    all
    HTML code.
  </p>
  <p>The opening <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing <b>&lt;/body&gt;</b> tag
    is
    information
    that will be displayed inside the main web browser. For example, images, text, search bar, etc.
  </p>
  <p>The opening <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing <b>&lt;/head&gt;</b> tag
    is
    information about the web page. Rather than information that is shown inside the main web browser window. You will
    usually find the <b>&lt;title&gt;</b> element inside the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b>.</p>
  <p>The opening <b>&lt;title&gt;</b> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing <b>&lt;/title&gt;</b> tag
    is
    information that that is displayed on the top of the web browser, above where you type the URL of a website or web
    page that you want to vist, basically the web browser tabs.</p>


  <!--HTML structure: attributes section-->
  <h3>Attributes</h3>
  <p>Attributes provide extra information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of a
    element
    and are made up of two parts. A attribute name and a attribute value which are separated by an equals sign. For
    example, this
    is a p (paragraph) element, <b>&lt;p lang="en-us"&gt;Paragraph in US
      english&lt;/p&gt;</b>, which contains attributes. Different attributes can have different values. The
    attribute name or in the case of the p element example, <b>lang</b>, indicates what kind of additional information
    you're supplying about the element's content. Also, HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names but this is
    not
    recommended. Therefore, all attribute names should always be written in lowercases. The
    attribute value or in the case of the p element example, <b>"en-us"</b>, is the information or setting for the
    attribute. It should always be placed inside double quotemarks. HTML5 allows quotemarks to be removed from
    attribute
    value. However, this is not recommended. Using the previous example, the attribute name <b>lang</b>, is used to
    indicate the language used in the p element.
    While, the attribute value <b>"en-us"</b>, specifies that the p element language being used is US english.</p>
