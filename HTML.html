  <h3>Elements</h3>
  <p>HTML uses elements to describe the structure of web pages. HTML code is made up of characters that live inside
    angled brackets, these are called HTML elements. For example,
    these are the HTML elements (&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;) that are used to create a paragraph on a web page. HTML elements
    are usually made up of two tags. An opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has a forward slash in it. For
    example, this is the opening tag (&lt;p&gt;) and closing tag (&lt;/p&gt;) that is used to create a paragraph on web
    page. Each HTML element tells the web browser something about the information that sits between its opening and
    closing tags.The opening and closing tags act like containers for information. Also, the character between the
    angled
    brackets indicates the tag's purpose. For example, the character p stands for paragraph which indicates it is used
    to create paragraphs.</p>
  <p>The opening &lt;html&gt; tag indicates that anything between it and the &lt;/html&gt; closing tag is all HTML code.
  </p>
  <p>The opening &lt;body&gt; tag indicates that anything between it and the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag is information
    that will be displayed inside the main web browser. For example, images, text, search bar, etc.
  </p>
  <h3>Attributes</h3>
  <p>Attributes provide extra information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of a element
    and are made up of two parts. A attribute name and a attribute value, separated by an equals sign. For example, this
    is a p (paragraph) element which contains attributes, &lt;p lang="en-us"&gt;Paragraph in US english&lt;/p&gt;. </p>
  <p>The attribute name or in the case of the p element example,'lang', indicates what kind of additional information
    you're supplying about the element's content. Also HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names but this is not
    recommended. Therefore, attribute names should always be written in lowercases.</p>
