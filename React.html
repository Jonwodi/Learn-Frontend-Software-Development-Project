    Node can also be downloaded specifically for macOS using homebrew, if you already have homebrew on your macOS using the followwing link: <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node">https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node</a>

  <p>Once you have finished dowloading node onto your operating system to make sure that node was correctly dowloaded onto your system and also to identify what version of node you have on your system enter the following code, <b>node -v</b>, into your terminal.
