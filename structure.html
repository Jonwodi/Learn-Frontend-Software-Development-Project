    <h1>Structure of HTML web pages</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="box2">
    <h2>HTML tags and elements</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. HTML describes the structure of web pages. HTML is made up of
      characters
      that live inside angled brackets, these
      are called HTML elements. HTML elements are usually made up of two tags, a opening and closing tag. The closing
      tag
      is similar to the opening tag with the exception that it contains a forward slash inside of it just before the
      character. Tags act like containers they tell us something about the information that lies between the opening and
      closing tag. For example, the opening html tag element shows us when html code begin whilst the html closing tag
      element shows us when the html code ends. Both the opening and closing tag start with a left angle bracket (less
      than sign) followed by the character which indicates the tag's purpose. For example, the character p would
      indicate
      the
      info between the tags is a paragraph. This is then followed by a right angle bracket (more than sign). The only
      difference between both tags is that the closing tag contains a forward slash just before the character whilst the
      opening tag dosen't contain a forward slash at all.</p>
    <h2>HTML attributes</h2>
    <p>Attributes provide more info about the contents of an element. They appear within the opening tag element,
      they're
      made
      of two parts: an attribute name and an attribute value which are seperated by an equals sign. The attribute name
      indicates what kind of extra info you're supplying about the element's content. The attribute name show be wriiten
      in a lowercase letters. The attribute value is the info or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in
      double
      quotation marks
      on each side of the attribute value. An example of an attribute is lang, which is used to indicate the language
      used
      in an element. This is an example of the lang attribute being used in the opening tag of p (paragraph) element,
      <b>p
        lang="en"</b>, the only things missing our the angled brackets.
    </p>
    <h2>The body, head & title elements</h2>
    <p>Any info between the body element opening and closing tags is displayed inside the main web browser window. The
      head element opening and clsoing tags contain info about the web page rather than info that is displayed inside
      the
      main web browser window. You will usually find a title element opening and closing tags between the head element
      opening and closing tags. The contents of the title element are usually displayed in the top of the web browser,
      above where you type the URL of the website or web page you want to vist. The title element's contents can also be
      shown in the tab of the web page.</p>
